# Status

Kept up to date after every work session so work can be resumed from this repository alone.

## Context

- Production-like target: Trino **455** (JDK 23 runtime; the stand runs JDK 25 with
  `--add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector --add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED`), offline deployment. Builds for
  Trino **477** and **483** are wanted too (`dep.trino.version`).
- Current released plugin = **v10** (commit 6ee7b0e + 07676d4 here): endpoint failover (try an endpoint's
  locations in order, switch only before any data was delivered and only on "unreachable" errors; never on
  server errors), headers `x-flight-result-mode: partial` + `x-flight-location-failover: 1`, connect timeout 5 s,
  keepalive 10 s, statistics from `SELECT count(*)` (+ min/max) answered by the server from Parquet footers,
  aggregate/filter/limit pushdown via `SqlQueryBuilder`/`ExpressionTranslator`.
- Validated on the maintainer's stand: TPC-H SF10 22/22 (checksum 05bc0dc2713a) on single node and 3-node
  clusters, plugin v9/v10 against server builds fix8–fix12, s3p4, tu1/to1; Trino 455.
- Server candidate for the next release: **int4** (branch integration-2: DuckDB 1.4.5, S3/lakeFS as plugins,
  cluster fixes for "losing 2 of 3 members returns a partial table" and "Invalid Flight endpoint ticket with token
  auth on a cluster"). Both bugs were seen through this plugin on the old server; they were server bugs.

## Invariants (must not regress)

- Never return wrong or partial results silently: failover only before the first batch; server errors surface.
- Token / bearer / basic auth and TLS options keep working (`flight.properties.example`).
- Works against the old server builds too (s3p4 behaviour: one location per endpoint).

## CI inputs

- Release `e2e-assets` (download with `gh release download e2e-assets`): `arrow-flight-server-1.0.0-int4.jar`,
  `int4-plugins.tar.zst` (`plugins/s3`, `plugins/lakefs`, **START-NOTES.txt — how to start the server**),
  `flight-server-libs.tar.zst` (`libs/`, on the classpath next to the jar), `test-data-sf1-types.tar.zst`
  (`sf1/tpch/<table>/*.parquet`, `types/<table>/*.parquet`), `SHA256SUMS`.
- In the repo: `e2e/ci/queries/q01..q22.sql` (TPC-H as run on the stand, schema `tpch`),
  `e2e/ci/reference/sf1/` (DuckDB 1.4.1 answers on the same SF1 files: `qNN.tsv`, `qNN.cols`, `MANIFEST.tsv`).
- CI implementation: `.github/workflows/build.yml` (push; `mvn -P trino-455 clean verify`, JDK 25; 477/483 via
  workflow_dispatch `all-versions`), `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` → `e2e/ci/run-e2e.sh` + `e2e/ci/compare.py`
  (push on plugin/e2e changes, matrix 1 and 3 servers; workflow_dispatch inputs trino / result-mode / servers).
  Every run also compares schema `types` (`e2e/ci/types_check.py`, DuckDB 1.4.1 + trino client from pip in the
  job) and, with 3 servers, runs the failover checks (see `docs/E2E-RESULTS.md`). Input `server-build` = int4|int5|int6 (int5+ also run `e2e/ci/iceberg.sh`).
  MinIO is no longer distributed (Docker Hub repo gone, quay.io unauthorized, release binaries 410), so S3 is
  `rclone/rclone:1.68.2 serve s3`. The server needs a writable working directory (DuckDB `.tmp`). The release
  is a draft, so the e2e job needs `contents: write` to download assets. Job logs: `gh api .../logs` is blocked
  by the session proxy (blob storage); the GitHub MCP `get_job_logs` tool works; artifacts can't be downloaded
  from the session.
- Server start (S3 mode; see START-NOTES, printed at the start of every e2e job): JDK 21, `LANG=C.UTF-8`,
  `-cp "<jar>:libs/*" pro.surpin.data.arrowflight.server.HadoopArrowFlightServer --localhost <host> --hosts <all>`,
  `-DdataDir=s3://lake/parquet -Ds3Endpoint=http://minio:9000 -Darrowflight.plugins.dir=<dir>/plugins`,
  httpfs **v1.4.5** (`http://extensions.duckdb.org/v1.4.5/linux_amd64/httpfs.duckdb_extension.gz`, keep the
  file name `httpfs.duckdb_extension`), MinIO credentials via `FLIGHT_S3_ACCESS_KEY`/`FLIGHT_S3_SECRET_KEY`
  (throwaway, generated in the job), auth `FLIGHT_ALLOW_INSECURE=true` or
  `FLIGHT_AUTH_PROVIDER=token FLIGHT_AUTH_TOKEN=<t>`, `-DresultMode=partial|complete`. Two or three servers
  (`--hosts a,b,c`) form a cluster with backup locations.
- Trino: `trinodb/trino:455` (and 477/483) image, plugin dir mounted at `/usr/lib/trino/plugin/arrow-flight`,
  catalog `connector.name=arrow_flight`, JVM flags from README.

## Next steps

> **Use server int6 instead of int5** (2026-10-22, local coordinator): int5 overflows its stack on the first table refresh ~30 s after start when any catalog is configured AND the data dir has a table (then every call fails "Application error processing RPC"). int6 = int5 + fix + catalog plugin `hive` (Hive Metastore; SPI 1.1): assets `arrow-flight-server-1.0.0-int6.jar` sha256 78f06212…8d09, `int6-plugins.tar.zst` sha256 fa870ddb…adaf (plugins s3/lakefs/iceberg/hive + START-NOTES.txt). With the iceberg plugin present, `catalog=hive` needs the iceberg+avro extensions or `hive.icebergTables=skip`.

1. **Iceberg in CI (server int6)** — in progress. Done (session 3): `e2e/ci/iceberg.sh`, on by default for
   `server-build` int5/int6 (`ICEBERG=0|1`): Spark 3.5.3 + Iceberg 1.6.1 (`apache/spark:3.5.3`, runtime jar from Maven
   Central) writes a HadoopCatalog warehouse `$WORK/wh` (namespace `ice`) from the SF1 Parquet; every server mounts it
   at `/wh` (`-Dcatalog=iceberg-hadoop -Darrowflight.iceberg-hadoop.warehouse=/wh -Darrowflight.catalog.localRootsShared=true`,
   DuckDB iceberg+avro v1.4.5, `core-site.xml` with `fs.file.impl` — see Open questions). Checks through Trino: tables
   listed; full copies lineitem/orders/customer = Parquet (row count + per-column `checksum`); rename (`c_comment` →
   `c_note`) OK; TPC-H q01 q03 q04 q06 q12 q13 q18 q22 on schema `ice` = DuckDB reference; a commit between two queries is
   seen by the second only. Green parts on int6, partial, 1 server (run 39851301285). Open:
   a) `ice.orders_del` (merge-on-read position deletes): server bug, KNOWN in CI (see Open questions); recheck when a
      fixed server build arrives and turn KNOWN back into FAIL.
   b) run int6 with `result-mode=complete` (expected: every Iceberg table hits the same iceberg_scan refusal) and with
      `servers=3` (partial: files spread over nodes, snapshot pinning, failover with catalog tickets).
   c) maybe an S3 warehouse (`s3://lake/parquet/...` under the dataDir) instead of the local one, if Spark+s3a is cheap
      enough; equality deletes (need Flink/pyiceberg) are not covered.
1b. **e2e: a kill in the middle of a stream** that already delivered data (must be a clean error, never fewer rows);
   all kills so far landed before the first batch (needs a larger/slower read, e.g. `SELECT *` of lineitem).
2. **Connection reset after one failed stream**: today one failed stream makes the plugin drop all its pooled
   connections (small inefficiency). Keep healthy connections; unit test.
3. **`ORDER BY … LIMIT` (TopN) pushdown** to the server (`applyTopN`): render `ORDER BY … LIMIT n` in
   `SqlQueryBuilder` when all sort keys are pushable columns; in partial mode each endpoint returns its own top n
   and Trino keeps its final TopN (do not report the TopN as fully guaranteed then); complete mode can guarantee
   it. Unit + e2e (TPC-H q03/q10/q18-style queries, results unchanged, fewer rows read).
4. **Dynamic filters**: review how dynamic filters are used (wait time, pushing IN-lists / ranges into the
   remote SQL, size limits). Measure on e2e SF1 joins (q05, q09); keep correct results.
5. **Split count**: review the number of splits per endpoint / per query against server nodes and Trino workers.
6. **Trino 477 and 483 builds**: make the plugin compile and pass e2e on both (SPI changes); document per-version
   build commands; keep 455 the default.

## Open questions
- **Server int6, Iceberg tables with delete files are unusable (local warehouse)**: the complete-answer view
  `iceberg_scan('/wh/ice/orders_del/metadata/v2.metadata.json')` is skipped at refresh — DuckDB: `Permission Error: Cannot
  access file "file:/wh/ice/orders_del/metadata/snap-….avro" - file system operations are disabled by configuration` —
  so the table is listed but `SELECT` fails "Table with name orders_del does not exist" (clean error, no wrong rows).
  The same skip is logged for every Iceberg table's view (e.g. ice.commits), so complete mode probably cannot read
  any Iceberg table from a local warehouse; partial mode works because it reads the data files. Metadata written by
  Spark/Hadoop uses `file:/…` URIs. Server fix needed (allow the catalog roots / `file:` scheme in DuckDB).
- **Server int6 with a local (`file`) warehouse fails at startup** with `No FileSystem for scheme "file"`
  (HadoopDataStoreProvider; the Hadoop jars in `libs/` do not register LocalFileSystem). CI works around it with a
  `core-site.xml` (`fs.file.impl=org.apache.hadoop.fs.LocalFileSystem`) on the server classpath. Fix in the server?

- e2e S3 is `rclone serve s3` instead of MinIO (MinIO images/binaries are no longer downloadable). OK, or is
  there a MinIO build you want to put into `e2e-assets`?
- The release now holds int4, int5 and int6; the e2e job picks one with `server-build` (default int4, the current
  release candidate). Switch the default to int6 once you consider it the candidate?
- `e2e-assets` is a draft release, so the e2e job runs with `contents: write`. Publishing it as a (private-repo)
  pre-release would let the job use `contents: read`. Your call — no change made.

## Log

- 2026-10-22 (maintainer's local session): repo created from the local project (HEAD 07676d4 = plugin v10 +
  failover test fix); CI inputs added; e2e assets uploaded.
- 2026-10-22 (cloud session 1): item 1 (CI). Added `build.yml` (green: run 39826570714) and `e2e.yml` +
  `e2e/ci/run-e2e.sh` + `e2e/ci/compare.py`. Trino 455, int4, token auth: partial mode 1 server TPC-H SF1 22/22
  (runs 39829220892, 39830281255) and 3 servers 22/22 + failover (flight2 killed before: 5/5 exact; flight3
  killed during q18: exact answer) (run 39830281255); complete mode 1 server 22/22 (run 39831337458).
  q01/q17 differ from DuckDB only by Trino's DECIMAL avg/division scale (comparator accepts, counts them).
  Fixes on the way: MinIO → rclone, writable server cwd, `extensionDir`, pipefail-safe pipes. No plugin code
  changed; no invariant affected.
- 2026-10-22 (cloud session 2): item 1 (CI) finished. a) `e2e/ci/types_check.py`: `types.alltypes` (23 cols) and
  `types.alltypes_full` (25 cols) x 5000 rows equal to DuckDB; interval/list/struct/map not exposed (skipped).
  b) failover checks rebuilt: node lost before (partitioned, then killed) 5+5 exact, but the int4 server never
  hands out a lost node, so it tests server re-planning only; kill during q18 proves plugin failover (3–4 streams
  "failed before any data … reading it from flight1", exact answer); two of three down 5/5 exact.
  c) complete mode on 3 servers 22/22 + failover (run 39836376906). Also fixed e2e broken by the second server jar
  in the release (`server-build` input). Runs: 39835656012 (1 srv), 39836376906 (complete 3 srv),
  39840087384 (partial 1+3 srv, final, green); failing intermediate runs 39836535174, 39837701866, 39838862758
  were the evidence checks being tuned. int5 baseline (parquet only, 1 server, partial): 22/22 + types 2/2
  (run 39841317139). No plugin code changed; no invariant affected.
